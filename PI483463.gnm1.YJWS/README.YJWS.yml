subject: Glycine soja accession PI 483463 genome assembly, v1.0

related_to: The genome assembly will be deposited in GenBank (anticipated late 2017). Changes are possible between assemblies in this repository and the GenBank instance.

genotype: PI 483463

description: The aims of this project were to generate a high-quality reference genome assembly for Glycine soja accession PI 483463, which shows high genotypic diversity with respect to elite cultivars from Glycine max (soybean). The assembly incorporates Illumina sequence and optical mapping from NRGene. Pseudomolecule anchoring of scaffolds was accomplished using two dense genetic maps as well as synteny comparisons with the Glycine max reference assembly for cultivar Williams 82 (JGI Glyma.Wm82.a2) and Glycine max cultivar Lee. This assembly corresponds to quality control round 13 (QC13), Nov 7, 2017

file_transformation: 
  - This pseudomolecule assembly derives from files Wild_soybean_genome.fasta and Wild_soybean_scaffolds.fasta received from NRGene, via Babu Valliyodan, April 6, 2017. Superscaffolds and all remaining scaffolds > 20,000 bp were evaluated by marker placement and using synteny with two other Glycine genome assemblies (Williams 82 and Lee) to assemble them into pseudomolecules (and remaining unanchored scaffolds).
  - Pseudomolecules were generated, with gap spacers of 100 Ns, with the command
  - order_and_orient.pl -OR QC13/glyso.PI483463.gnm1.YJWS.order_orient.txt \
  - -out QC13/glyso.PI483463.gnm1.YJWS.pchr_entire \
  - -in 02_Gs_scaffs_ge20k_split_clean -reverse -spacer 100 -entire -v

changes: 
  - 2017-11-08: masked mitochondrial, chloroplast, and adaptor sequences, after checking for apparent true/biological insertions (by comparison with three other Glycine assemblies: Williams 82, Lee, and G. soja W05). The following assemblies were masked:
  - Gs.sc102	chloroplast
  - Gs.sc117	mitochondrial
  - Gs.sc126	mitochondrial
  - Gs.sc135	chloroplast
  - Gs.sc139	mitochondrial
  - Gs.sc216	adaptor:NGB00719.1
  - Gs.sc25	adaptor:NGB00714.1
  - Gs.sc430	mitochondrial
  - Gs.sc75	mitochondrial
  - Gs.sc83	mitochondrial
  - Gs.sc88	mitochondrial
  - 2017-11-15: changed filename from glyso.PI483463.gnm1.YJWS.fna to glyso.PI483463.gnm1.YJWS.genome_main.fna , which resulted in a new md5 hash
  - 2018-03-02 added MANIFEST files
  - 2018-03-02 prefixed pseudomolecules and scaffolds with "glyso.PI483463.gnm1."
  - 2019-05-10 Fixed prefixing on scaffolds in the .fna files. Prefixes had an extraneous ".Gs"; e.g. glyso.PI483463.gnm1.Gs.sc286 should have been glyso.PI483463.gnm1.sc286
